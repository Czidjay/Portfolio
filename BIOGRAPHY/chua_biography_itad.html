            Have you ever noticed <strong>how life moves to its own rhythm</strong>, sometimes fast and exhilarating, other times slow and uncertain? <sup>1</sup> 
            Looking back at my childhood, <em><b>my rhythm was fast paced, lively, and filled with the beat of drums, the melody of lyres, and the energy of performances.</b></em> <sup>2</sup> 
            I was the kind of kid who could not sit still, always signing up for anything that caught my interest. <sup>3</sup> 
            In elementary school, I threw myself into every club, organization, and competition that I could find. <sup>4</sup> 
            The Drum and Lyre Corps became my second home. <sup>5</sup> 
            <b>I was a colorguard, a lyrist, and later, a drummer.</b> <sup>6</sup> 
            Every practice session was filled with aching shoulders, sweat, and the thrill of perfecting every beat. <sup>7</sup> 
            All that hard work paid off when I was awarded <i>Best Drummer</i> and <i>Best Lyrist</i> upon graduating. <sup>8</sup> 
            But music was not my only passion, <b>I also spent years as a Girl Scout,</b> where I discovered my love for performing. <sup>9</sup> 
            I joined dance competitions and was a familiar face at school events like Foundation Days and Teacher’s Day, always ready to step onto the stage. <sup>10</sup> 
            One of the <b>most meaningful experiences I had was as a peer educator</b>, where I visited different public schools to teach students about bullying. <sup>11</sup> 
            In turn, I learned so much from them, their struggles and their hopes for a kinder school environment. <sup>12</sup> 
            My rhythm did not stop at music and performance. <sup>13</sup> 
            Sports played a huge role in my childhood, too. <sup>14</sup> 
            <b>Badminton was my favorite sport,</b> and I was lucky enough to represent my school in competitions. <sup>15</sup> 
            Stepping onto the court, racket in hand, it was exciting. <sup>16</sup> 
            Competing against players from different schools was both nerve-wracking and thrilling, and nothing compared to the feeling of playing my best, especially with my friends cheering me on from the sidelines. <sup>17</sup> 
            But as much as I loved the sport, <em>winning was not always guaranteed.</em> <sup>18</sup> 
            I fought hard, but I eventually lost and was not able to qualify for <i>“Palarong Pambansa”</i>. <sup>19</sup> 
            Despite all of these busy schedules, I was not the <i>"gala"</i> type of kid that just wandered aimlessly. <sup>20</sup> 
            I mostly stuck to a routine of home, school, then home, unless it was related to my extracurricular. <sup>21</sup> 
            Balancing my academics and extracurriculars was exhausting, especially with the pressure of living up to my mother’s high expectations, but I always made sure to stay in the Top 10 of my class. <sup>22</sup> 
            Early mornings of studying, sacrificing playtime, and pushing myself way beyond my limits were the price I had to pay, but I knew it was worth it. <sup>23</sup> 
            Despite the struggles, <strong><em>my childhood was special.</em></strong> <sup>24</sup> 
            It was during this time that <b>I traveled abroad for the first time,</b> visiting Hong Kong and San Francisco, California. I still remember the overwhelming excitement of stepping into a new country, the bright lights of Disneyland, and the euphoric feeling as I stood in a place so different from home. <sup>25</sup> 
            It was an unforgettable experience that <em>made me dream of seeing more of the world one day in the future.</em> <sup>26</sup></blockquote>

              Teenage years are supposed to be about discovering yourself, but for me, <em><b>my rhythm began to change.</b></em> <sup>1</sup> 
              It became <em><b>slower, more deliberate</b></em>, as I started making tougher choices. <sup>2</sup> 
              <em>I had always loved performing,</em> but I knew that if I joined another club in high school, <strong>I might lose control of my priorities again.</strong> <sup>3</sup> 
              When my high school formed its very first Drum and Lyre Corps, I could not resist the chance to be part of it. <sup>4</sup> 
              As a lyrist once again, it felt like stepping back into a familiar world. <sup>5</sup> 
              Every performance brought a surge of nostalgia. <sup>6</sup> 
              It brought back the same rush I felt in elementary school, but this time, something was different. <sup>7</sup> 
              As much as I loved it, the constant practices started to take a toll. <sup>8</sup> 
              Members were frequently excused from classes, and I found myself missing important lectures. <sup>9</sup> 
              At first, I convinced myself that I could balance both just as I did in elementary. <sup>10</sup> 
              But as time passed, the stress of catching up became overwhelming. <sup>11</sup> 
              The joy of playing was slowly overshadowed by the stress of keeping up with my studies. <sup>12</sup> 
              After a year, I made the decision to quit. <sup>13</sup> 
              So, for the first time, <strong><em>I stepped away from extracurriculars and really focused on my academics.</em></strong> <sup>14</sup> 
              It was actually a difficult decision, especially when I discovered my school’s drama club. <sup>15</sup> 
              A part of me wanted to feel to be on stage again, but I reminded myself why I had to let go. <sup>16</sup> 
              Then, before I could even fully adjust to high school life, <strong>the pandemic happened.</strong> <sup>17</sup> 
              One moment, I was laughing with my friends in class, and the next, I was stuck in my room, staring at a Google Meet screen for hours. <sup>18</sup> 
              The <em>transition from face-to-face learning to online classes was brutal.</em> <sup>19</sup> 
              The days blurred together, and no matter how much time passed, it felt like I was just stuck in the same place. <sup>20</sup> 
              The same four walls, the same routine, the same feeling of uncertainty. <sup>21</sup> 
              I was not just exhausted, I was afraid of failing. <sup>22</sup> 
              I wanted my family to be proud of me and to finally stop the comparisons that had followed me for years. <sup>23</sup> 
              I carried the weight of expectations on my shoulders. <sup>24</sup> 
              Even when I was breaking inside, I hid my exhaustion because I did not want them to see me like this. <sup>25</sup> 
              And then, <strong>life threw something even heavier at me.</strong> <sup>26</sup> 
              My mom was diagnosed with <em>Stage 3 Cervical Cancer.</em> <sup>27</sup> 
              It was the kind of news you think only happens in movies, something you never expect to hear in your own home. <sup>28</sup> 
              I was not prepared, none of us were. <sup>29</sup> 
              There were sleepless nights, silent prayers, and days when I felt completely helpless. <sup>30</sup> 
              The sight of my mother, strong, unwavering, yet very fragile, broke my heart in ways I could not explain. <sup>31</sup> 
              But through it all, we never gave up. <sup>32</sup> 
              <strong><em>We held onto faith,</em></strong> supported her through every appointment and therapy session, and fought alongside her. <sup>33</sup> 
              That experience changed me. <sup>34</sup> 
              It made me realize that <strong><em>pain is inevitable, but it does not define us.</em></strong> <sup>35</sup></blockquote>

              Now, as a college student, <em><b>I am composing a new melody for my life.</b></em> <sup>1</sup> 
              One that is filled with both challenges and discoveries. <sup>2</sup> 
              I chose <strong>Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT)</strong> in the <strong>University of the East</strong> not just because it is in demand, but because I have always been curious about technology and how it shapes the world. <sup>3</sup> 
              The idea of creating something from scratch, solving problems, and <em>being part of something this big fascinated me.</em> <sup>4</sup> 
              <em>College was a culture shock,</em> it felt so different from high school. <sup>5</sup> 
              At first I was really not sure I would be able to keep up. <sup>6</sup> The fast paced environment, the heavy workload, and the expectations felt really overwhelming. <sup>7</sup> 
              But I slowly adjusted, and along the way, <strong>I met amazing friends,</strong> people who understood me, supported me, and made me feel at home. <sup>8</sup> 
              They became my support system, my reminders that <em>I am not alone in this journey.</em> <sup>9</sup> 
              <strong>My first year was an eye-opener.</strong> <sup>10</sup>
              IT was far more complex than I had imagined. <sup>11</sup> 
              The assignments, projects, and coding exercises pushed me beyond my limits, but at the same time, I genuinely felt a sense of accomplishment every time I learned something new. <sup>12</sup> 
              The feeling of solving a problem after hours of frustration, finally understanding how to write a working code that seemed impossible at first, made everything felt really worth it. <sup>13</sup> 
              Despite the challenges in learning how to program and keep up with the demands of my course, <strong>I am incredibly grateful to have attained a scholarship.</strong> <sup>14</sup> 
              More than anything, I wanted one so badly, not just because it would make me happy or make my parents proud, but because it meant easing even just a little of the financial burden on my family. <sup>15</sup> 
              Tuition fees were no joke, and knowing that I could somehow lessen that weight on my parents made all my hard work even more meaningful. <sup>16</sup> 
              But it was not just academics that challenged me. <sup>17</sup> 
              One of the <em>harshest realities I faced</em> throughout the years, from elementary to college, is that <strong><em>not everyone who calls themselves a friend will actually stand by your side when things get tough.</em></strong> <sup>18</sup> 
              In the beginning, college felt like a fresh start, a chance to meet new people, form meaningful connections, and build friendships that would last a lifetime. And for a while, it seemed like that. <sup>19</sup> 
              Late night study sessions, shared struggles over difficult assignments, and endless laughter made it feel like these friendships would really last. <sup>20</sup> 
              But just like in the past, <em>reality had a way of revealing the truth.</em> <sup>21</sup> 
              Group projects tested patience, deadlines exposed true work ethics, and difficult moments showed who was willing to stay and who was only there when things were easy. <sup>22</sup> 
              Some friends slowly became distant, messages were left unanswered, and moments of support were met with silence. <sup>23</sup> 
              It hurt, realizing that people who once felt like family could disappear without warning. <sup>24</sup> 
              But despite everything, I kept going. <sup>25</sup>
              <strong>Now in my second year,</strong> I can somehow say that <em><b>I have found my rhythm.</b></em> <sup>26</sup> 
              College is tough, life is unpredictable, and the future is uncertain, but I have learned to <strong><em>take things one step at a time.</em></strong> <sup>27</sup> 
              No matter what happens, <strong><em>I will keep growing, keep learning, and keep chasing after the future I want to build for myself.</em></strong> <sup>28</sup></blockquote>
